   - Themes: Explore underlying messages, symbols, and universal truths
   - Character Analysis: Examine character development, motivations, and relationships

   - All: Mix of different types for comprehensive discussion

2. **Question Quality:**
   - Make questions open-ended and thought-provoking
   - Avoid yes/no questions
   - Encourage deep analysis and personal connection
   - Vary difficulty and depth
   - Include specific references to the text when possible

3. **Format:**
   - Generate exactly the requested number of questions
   - Each question should be clear and concise
   - Focus on the specified topic or chapter range
   - Make questions suitable for group discussion

4. **Context Awareness:**
   - If a specific chapter or page range is provided, focus on that content
   - If uploaded text is provided, base questions on that content
   - If only a book name is provided, create general questions about the book

5. **Output Format:**
   Return only the questions as a JSON array of strings, like:
   ["Question 1", "Question 2", "Question 3"]
