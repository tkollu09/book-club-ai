â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ InputPanel.jsx      # Left sidebar with form inputs
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ OutputPanel.jsx     # Right panel with question display

## Customization

### Adding OpenAI Integration

To integrate with real OpenAI API:

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory
2. Add your OpenAI API key:
   ```
   VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

3. Replace the mock question generation in `App.jsx` with actual API calls

### Styling

The app uses Tailwind CSS with a custom color scheme. You can modify:
- `tailwind.config.js` for theme customization
- `src/index.css` for custom component styles
